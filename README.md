Pedantic Buffers, Tabs and Windows
Navigating through Buffers, Tabs, Windows and maintaining their opened positions
Enables opening relevant windows depending on the selected file. 
It's regarded pedantic in terms of the placement of buffers and windows relative to their Tabs

Motivation:
Sometimes I have to work on a project that has several sub-sections, and some have 
similarly named files. Having these buffers separated makes it easier to maintaining the understanding of 
the project.
The workflow would involve having tabs separate buffers and windows that are in use for the project.

To enable on Lazy Plugin Manager

```viml
{
  "teddywaweru/pedantic-btw.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  opts = {},
  keys = {
  {
    'gj', '<cmd>lua require("pedantic-btw").buffer_list()<CR>', 'n', desc = "Open Buffer List" }
  },
}
```
